CREATIVE COMPUTING PROJECT 2

Whiskers of War is a story-driven survival game in which players assume the role of a determined cat negotiating the harsh reality of a war-torn planet.  By carefully balancing action-packed confrontations ("On") with stealthy, thoughtful times ("Off"), players must make morally significant decisions, manage survival resources, and evade predatory predators.  Inspired by games like Stray, Spec Ops: The Line, and This War of Mine, the game blends exciting gaming mechanics, emotive storytelling, and deep ethical quandaries to explore themes of perseverance, empathy, and survival from a distinctively non-human perspective.

I created this game with the primary purpose of telling a striking story about the brutal reality and profound repercussions of war, with a focus on innocent people that suffer unjustly.  The plot develops from the unusual perspective of a determined cat on a journey to reconnect with her lost kittens amidst the turmoil and devastation of war.  Throughout the production process, I greatly appreciated the lessons supplied by the YouTube channel BornCG, whose extensive instruction and resources were invaluable in bringing this game to life.
